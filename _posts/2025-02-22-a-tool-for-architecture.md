## Introduction

**Clean Architecture** the last artcicle i talked about the architecture. How we implement it in our project. And how we can use it to build a microservice. How we can maintain the architecture and everyone can understand it and follow it.

This article is a tool for architecture. I will introduce a tool that can help us to implement the architecture. When we create the project, we can use this tool to generate the project structure. And the best practice can include in the tool. It includes **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and how it contrasts with or enhances traditional **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**. We’ll also dissect how to organize packages for these architectures.

## What is the tool

The tool is a tool that can help us to implement the architecture. It is a tool that can help us to generate the project structure. And the best practice can include in the tool. It includes **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, and how it contrasts with or enhances traditional **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**. We’ll also dissect how to organize packages for these architectures.

## The package structure and the best practice

The tool will generate the package structure and the best practice for the architecture.


## Conclusion

Clean Architecture provides a robust blueprint for maintainable systems by isolating business logic from external concerns. When combined with DDD, it excels in modeling complex domains, while adapting MVC keeps UI-focused apps structured. By organizing packages according to architectural boundaries, teams can achieve clarity, scalability, and testability. Whether building a microservice with DDD or a web app with MVC, Clean Architecture’s principles ensure your codebase remains resilient to change.
