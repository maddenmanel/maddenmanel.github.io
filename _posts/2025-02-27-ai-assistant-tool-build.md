## Conclusion

Clean Architecture provides a robust blueprint for maintainable systems by isolating business logic from external concerns. When combined with DDD, it excels in modeling complex domains, while adapting MVC keeps UI-focused apps structured. By organizing packages according to architectural boundaries, teams can achieve clarity, scalability, and testability. Whether building a microservice with DDD or a web app with MVC, Clean Architectureâ€™s principles ensure your codebase remains resilient to change.
